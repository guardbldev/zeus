title: "Network Inspector"
description: "Analyze RemoteEvent and RemoteFunction payload sizes to reduce lag and bandwidth usage."
---


## Overview

The Network Payload Inspector monitors RemoteEvent and RemoteFunction traffic to measure

payload sizes, detect inefficient data structures, and identify network bottlenecks.

This feature helps developers reduce lag caused by oversized or frequent remote calls.

---

## Benefits

- Reduces server-client bandwidth usage

- Prevents hidden lag spikes

- Improves scalability for large player counts

---

## How It Works

1. Remote calls are intercepted in a safe wrapper

2. Payloads are serialized and measured

3. Results are logged and ranked

### Internal Behavior

- Hooks RemoteEvent connections

- Estimates serialized table size

- Does NOT store sensitive player data

---

## Commands

### Primary Commands

```
net.inspect
```

**Description:**

Begins monitoring network payload sizes during runtime.

**Options:**

`-- live`  - This command shows payloads in real-time, this can help reduce lag reduction

`-- threshold`  - This command shows the minimum size to report

### Example Usage

```
net.inspect --threshold=5kb
```

What we get from this are the lists of the top remote calls by payload size and the higlights the problematic routes .

### Output Example

```
net.inspect --threshold=5kb
[]

Output type: Console report
Severity levels: Info, Warning
Exportable (JSON): Yes 
```

### Limits

To prevent the plugin from taken down, we have taken various steps and added security features to comply with Roblox TOS. Features such as this include:

- Does not modify remote behavior
- Does not log player-identifiable data
- Play mode only

### When Best to use it

Run this during high-profile simulations and use alongide the Performance Profiler for best results.
